Does your company face business-critical decisions that rely on dynamic transactional data? If you answered “yes,” you need to attend this free, hands-on event featuring Microsoft analytic tools. We’ll focus on Azure Machine Learning capabilities and explore the following topics: 
+ Common machine learning algorithms 
+ Data sourcing options and model-building prep
+ Selecting and setting up your first model 
+ Building predictive experiments 
+ Understanding and interpreting the output 

We’ll use real-world data to solve business problems that are relevant to your organization. 
So, if you’re a developer interested in machine learning or a data scientist expanding your skill set, this is a must-camp to do! 
 
Discover what’s possible with machine learning. 
Space is limited for this one-of-a-kind, interactive session, where you’ll see how to uncover patterns and make predictions using the power of Azure Machine Learning. You’ll also discover how to select, validate and set up optimal models, and how to interpret the output. At the end of the day, you’ll understand how Azure Machine Learning can improve your data insights. 

## Who should do this camp?
This technical event is for developers interested in data science and especially, machine learning. Previous experience with Microsoft Azure and/or Visual Studio is helpful, but not essential.
